    <h2>Joyce Nwokoro</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Joyce. I am 23years old and single. 
        I have five other siblings and we live in the sourthern part <br> of Nigeria, a town called Uyo.</br></p>
    <p>I have a Bachelor of science degree in Genetics and Biotchnology were I graduated with first class honours. I work two jobs,
        <br> a full time and remote part time role to take care of myself and siblings. </br></p>
    <p>I and my family have been members of the church for 7years and it's been one of the best decisions we've ever made. 
        <br>I am a teacher in the Young Single Adult's class and the YSA female activity specialist in my ward. </br></p>
    <p>I developed love for software development last year and I felt Why not? Go get a degree, Joyce &#128516; </p>
    <p>I love playing scrabble and watching science fictional movies. It is a pleasure taking this course with you all.</p>
